        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Roronoa Zoro was the first member to join Luffy on his great adventure
            <br> to become Pirate King in both the manga and anime series One Piece.<br>
            Initially known as 'Pirate Hunter Zoro',
            the bloodthirsty swordsman uses <br> a unique three-sword fighting style.
            He is generally considered the second <br> most powerful member of the Straw Hat Pirates next to Luffy.</i></p>
        <p style="margin-left:auto;">Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates,
            and dreamt <br> of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of <br> his idol and mentor
            Red-Haired  Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from <br> the East Blue Sea to the Grand
            Line in search of the legendary <br> treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Red-haired Shanks is one of the most important characters in Eiichiro Oda's One Piece.<br>
        Introduced at the very beginning of the story, Shanks played quite an important role as
        he paved way for Luffy to set out <br> on his journey to becoming the Pirate King. <br> By entrusting
        his Straw Hat to Luffy, Shanks asked the young pirate to return it to him one day when he
        becomes a Great Pirate. Evidently, Shanks was <br> always going to be quite a crucial character 
        in the story moving forward, however, the majority <br> of things about him remain unknown still.</i></p>
